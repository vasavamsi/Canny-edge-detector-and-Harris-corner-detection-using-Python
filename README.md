# Canny Edge Detector:
The code has been written on the basis of the Algorithm taught in the lectures of Computer Vision.
**Algorithm Step by Step:**
1) Sobel edge detection of the Gaussian Blurred image.
2) Magnitude and Direction of the Gradient obtained from the outputs of Step-1.
3) Non-minimal Suppression.
4) Hysterisis thresholding.
5) Edge linking

**Instructions to run the code**
>> Run test_script.py in codes folder
>> Result images will be saved in the same folder itself
>> demo input images are already loaded
>> to test on other images please copy them to the same directory and change the image name in the test_script.py.
